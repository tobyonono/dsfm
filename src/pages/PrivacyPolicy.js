                                        We are committed to protecting the security of your personal data. We use a variety of
                                        security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal data from unauthorised
                                        access and use. Your personal data is held in electronic format although, in certain
                                        circumstances, hard copy documentation maybe held for the purpose of corporate
                                        governance. In this event, hard copy documentation pertaining to your personal data, will be
                                        held securely and access will only be by authorised personnel.
